Sample RM Cobol Program Notes:

1. Define NUM-RECS AND RET-CODE as COMP-1 (binary).

Linking RM Cobol 2.x with Opt-Tech Sort

RM Cobol does not require linking with Opt-Tech 
Sort.  However, SORTRM.COM  must be on the default 
drive and directory when running your program.  
SORTRES must be loaded before running your RM Cobol 
program.  Load SORTRES with a workarea size 
specified.

Supported RM/COBOL 2.x File Types

Line Sequential - This is a standard ASCII text 
type file. Just specify your sort fields on the 
sort control statement.  No other parameters are 
necessary.

Binary Sequential - There are two different formats 
of Binary sequential files.  1. If your records are 
all the same length, then the sequential binary 
file contains just your data records.  To sort this 
type of file specify your sort control field(s) 
along with the FILETYPE(FIX,nnn) or RECORD(nn) 
parameter on your sort control statement.
2. If your records are varying length, (ie. you 
have different length records defined in the FD for 
the file) then they have a two byte length field on 
the front of each record.  Specify your sort 
field(s) and Filetype(MS) on your control statement.

Relative Files - This type of file contains fixed 
length records.  Specify your sort control fields 
and the FILETYPE(FIX,nnnn) or RECORD(nnnn) 
parameter on your sort control statement.

Dual File Indexed - This type of file consists of 
two distinct files, the index and the data.  The 
data portion of the indexed file consists of fixed 
length records. It can be sorted by specifying your 
sort control fields and FILETYPE(FIX,nnnn) or 
RECORD(nnnn) on your sort control statement.  The 
sorted output file can then be read as a Binary 
Sequential or Relative file.
