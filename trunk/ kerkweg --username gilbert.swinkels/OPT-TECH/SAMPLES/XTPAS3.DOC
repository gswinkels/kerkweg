Sample Turbo Pascal Version 3 Program Notes:

1) Turbo Pascal interfaces with the resident 
version of Opt-Tech Sort (SORTRES).  As Turbo 
Pascal does not allow Opt-Tech Sort to dynamically 
allocate memory, a workarea size must be specified 
when loading SORTRES before you can calling Opt-
Tech Sort from Turbo Pascal. 

2) An interface module called SORTBTP.COM is 
provided to allow you to easily call Opt-Tech Sort 
from Turbo Pascal.  SORTBTP.COM is an interface 
module to SORTRES which gets included with your 
Turbo Pascal program when you compile.

3) See Chapter Four on Memory Considerations and 
Loading SORTRES.
