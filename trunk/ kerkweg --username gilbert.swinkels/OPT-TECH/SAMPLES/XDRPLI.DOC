Sample DR PL/I program notes:

1. The Opt-Tech Sort interface for PL/I is SORTPLI.

2. NUMREC and RETCODE must be FIXED BINARY.


Linking Digital Research PL/I with Opt-Tech Sort

1. A separate object module SORTPLI.OBJ has been 
included for linking with your  PL/I program.

2. You must use your PL/I LINK86 linker to link    
your PL/I program with Opt-Tech Sort.

3. An example of linking the sample program is    
shown below.  

     A> LINK86  XDRPLI,SORTPLI

4) D/R PL/I does not allow Opt-Tech Sort to 
dynamically allocate memory.  Therefore you must 
load SORTRES with a workarea size.  See Chapter 
Four (Loading SORTRES).
