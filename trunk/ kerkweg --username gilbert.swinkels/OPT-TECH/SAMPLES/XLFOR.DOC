Sample Lahey Fortran Program Notes:

1. The Opt-Tech Sort entry point used with Lahey 
Fortran is "SORTLF".

2. RETCODE must be defined as a 2 byte integer.  
NUMRECS can be a four byte integer if the 4Byte 
parameter is specified on your control statement.

3. The Calling method described in previous Opt-
Tech Sort Manuals of calling the Microsoft Fortran 
entry point SORTF, declaring SORTF to be MSEXTERNAL 
and putting a slash "/" at the end of the INFILE, 
OUTFILE and CTLSTMT parameters still works with 
Version 4 Opt-Tech Sort.  The method described in 
this manual and show in the sample program is 
simpler and also works with Lahey Personal Fortran.

4. When linking with Lahey Fortran F77L you should 
use the object module F77LFS.OBJ (provided on the 
Lahey Fortran master diskette).  This allows  
Opt-Tech Sort to be able to dynamically allocate 
memory.  Otherwise you must link with one of our
fixed size work areas (ie. SW40K etc.) or you will
get an error 222.
