Sample Assembly Language Program Notes

As noted in the Assembly Language source code Opt-
Tech Sort can be invoked two ways.  Either by 
calling the FAR entry point _MAINS or by using 
software interrupt 7DH after loading SORTRES.  In 
either case, the calling program must establish the 
parameter block and put the parameter block segment 
and offset into DS:DX before calling Opt-Tech Sort.

The Opt-Tech Sort module containing the FAR entry 
point _MAINS is contained in SORT.LIB.  Therefore 
if your program calls _MAINS you will need to LINK 
with SORT.LIB.
