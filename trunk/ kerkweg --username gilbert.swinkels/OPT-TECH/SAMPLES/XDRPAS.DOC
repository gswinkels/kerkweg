Sample D/R Pascal/MT+ Program Notes:

1) The entry point used with Pascal/MT+ is SORTMT.


Linking D/R Pascal/MT+ with Opt-Tech Sort

1) You must use LINKMT to link your program with    
the Opt-Tech Sort interface module SORTMT.R86.  

   A>LINKMT  XDRPAS, SORTMT, PASLIB/S

2) D/R Pascal/MT+ does not allow Opt-Tech Sort to 
dynamically allocate memory.  Therefore you must 
load SORTRES with a workarea size.  See Chapter 
Four (Loading SORTRES).
