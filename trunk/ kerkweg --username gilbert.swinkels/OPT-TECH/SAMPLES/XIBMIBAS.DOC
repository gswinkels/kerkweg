Sample Interpreted BASIC Program Notes:

1) Lines 110-130 obtain and define the segment 
address where SORTIBAS is loaded.

2) Lines 140-190 setup the parameters and CALLs the 
sort program.


Linking Interpreted BASIC with Opt-Tech Sort:

Interpreted BASIC (BASIC, BASICA, GWBASIC) calls 
Opt-Tech Sort through SORTIBAS which invokes 
SORTRES.  


How to load SORTIBAS

SORTIBAS is a resident program that provides the 
interface between the BASIC interpreter and the 
resident version of Opt-Tech Sort (SORTRES).
SORTIBAS is loaded simply by running the program 
SORTIBAS from DOS.  The format of the command is:

     SORTIBAS [filename]

The filename parameter is optional, it specifies 
the name of the file that the segment address 
(DEF SEG) of SORTIBAS  will be written to.  If a 
filename is not specified the DEF SEG address will 
be written to a file named SORTIBAS.SEG.  This file 
contains the address where SORTIBAS is loaded.  

Once SORTIBAS is loaded, it remains in memory until 
you turn off or reboot your computer.

Since SORTIBAS and SORTRES work together, both 
programs must be loaded before you can call 
SORTIBAS from interpreted BASIC.  You can load 
these programs in either order but if you want to 
remove SORTRES from memory with the /R parameter, 
SORTRES must be the last program loaded.

IBM Interpreted BASIC and GWBASIC allow Opt-Tech
Sort to dynamically allocate memory, so SORTRES 
can be loaded without specifying a workarea size.  


See Chapter Four on how to load SORTRES.      

Interpreted BASIC Filetypes:

Interpreted BASIC has one type of random file and 
two types of Sequential files.  

RANDOM files are created using the PUT statement.  
Random records are fixed length and have no record 
delimiters or end of file markers.  Either the 
Record parameter or the FIXed filetype parameter 
should be specified on your Sort control statement.  
The record length is the value in the OPEN 
statement.  Fields are defined by their actual 
position & length in the record.  An index into 
your random files can be built with Opt-Tech Sort 
using the Keyout, Addrout, or OUTRec parameters.

Sequential files are created with the PRINT and WRITE  
statements and are text files (FILETYPE(TXT)).

Text files created with the PRINT statement may 
contain fixed or variable length records.  The 
control fields can be specified by starting 
position and length or by relative field position.

Text files created with the WRITE statement are 
usually variable length with the fields delimited 
by commas.  FILETYPE(TXT) and the DELimiter(44) 
parameters should be specified for these files.  
Please see the DELimiter parameter in Chapter Four 
for an example of specifying relative type control 
fields.
