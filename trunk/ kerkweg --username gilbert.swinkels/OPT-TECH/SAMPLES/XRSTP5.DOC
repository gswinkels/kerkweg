Sample Turbo Pascal Version 4 and 5 notes.

1. Turbo Pascal Version 4 and 5 interface with 
Opt-Tech Sort via a unit named SORTBTPU.TPU.  This
unit does not exist on the Opt-Tech Sort master 
diskette but can be created easily by compiling	the
program SORTBTPU.PAS to disk.  SORTBTPU.OBJ is 
required when compiling SORTBTPU.PAS.  Both of these
files can be found on diskette #1. 

Note: The reason we do not provide the SORTBTPU.TPU
already compiled is that a unit is not compatible 
across different versions of Turbo Pascal.  By 
making the unit yourself you can keep current with 
new Turbo Pascal versions.

2. It is not necessary to load the memory resident 
version of Opt-Tech Sort (SORTRES.EXE).

3. The Opt-Tech Sort RAAT interface can not be 
used in an overlay.
