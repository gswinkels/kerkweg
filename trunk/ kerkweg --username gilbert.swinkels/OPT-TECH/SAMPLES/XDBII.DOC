Sample dBASE II Program Notes

Overview

You can use Opt-Tech Sort as a DOS command or call 
it as a subroutine directly from dBASE II.  Both of 
these methods are described below.
 
You should be familiar with the General Information 
(Chapter Two) and the Control Statement (Chapter 
Five) before using Opt-Tech Sort to sort a dBASE II 
file.

In order to specify your control fields you must 
know your record layout. You can use the dBASE II 
command 'List Structure' to show the record layout 
of a dBASE II data base record.

A sample dBASE II data base (SAMPDBII.DBF) is 
included on your Opt-Tech Sort distribution 
diskette.  The following example lists the 
structure of the sample data base file.

003     PHONE        C    013          
004     CITY         C    014          
005     STATE        C    003          
006     ZIPCODE      C    005          
** TOTAL **             00069

The first character of a dBASE II record is a one 
byte 'delete' indicator.  The 'delete' indicator is 
not shown when you do a list structure, although 
its length is counted in the total displayed.  You 
must consider this 'delete' byte when specifying 
your sort field starting positions.

Field starting positions can be calculated by 
adding two (2) to the combined length of the 
preceding fields.  


dBASE II Control Statement Considerations

The control statement that is described in Chapter 
Five allows you to specify the sort control fields 
as well as other information to Opt-Tech Sort.
  
You should use the field type of 'C' (Character) 
for all dBASE II fields except for signed numeric 
fields which should have the field type of 'N' 
(Numeric).

You must use FILETYPE(DBII) on your control 
statement to indicate that you are processing a 
dBASE II data base.


Using as a Subroutine from dBASE II

Introduction

To call Opt-Tech Sort directly from dBASE II you 
must first make Opt-Tech Sort resident in your 
computers memory.  This is accomplished by running 
the SORTRES program from DOS. See Chapter Four.

Opt-Tech Sort will remain in your computers memory 
until your system is turned off, rebooted, or 
removed from memory with the SORTRES /R parameter.

Once Opt-Tech Sort is resident in your computers 
memory you can use dBASE II as you normally do.  
Opt-Tech Sort will be available for use directly 
from dBASE II.
 

Calling Opt-Tech Sort from dBASE II

A simple command file named SORTDBII.PRG is 
provided on your distribution diskette.  This 
command file requires that you establish values for 
three memory variables before you 'DO SORTDBII'.

Input memory variables used:

INFILE - (Input File) - is the name of the data 
base you want to sort, you must specify the 
complete file name including the '.DBF' extension.  
You can only process one dBASE II file at a time.

OUTFILE - (Output File) is the name of the file 
where you want the sorted data to be placed.  This 
can be the same name as your input file.  Caution, 
if a system malfunction or power failure occurs 
while sorting the input file to itself, there is 
the potential for loss of data.  

CTLSTMT - (Control Statement) - specifies the 
area(s) within your dBASE II record you wish to 
sort on.  The control statement format is described 
in Chapter Five.

After the sort completes the memory variables 
RETCODE and NUMREC are returned to your program. 

RETCODE - (Return Code) is a number indicating if 
an error occurred while performing the sort.  A 
zero value indicates successful completion.

NUMREC - (Number of Records) is a number indicating  
the number of records processed by the sort.

Sample dBASE II Subroutine Sort

If Opt-Tech Sort has not been loaded into your 
computers memory then you must first run SORTRES 
from DOS see Chapter Four on how to load SORTRES.
The dBASE II command file shown below 
(XDBII.PRG)  is contained on your distribution 
diskette.  This command file can be used along with 
the sort command file SORTDBII.PRG to sort the 
sample data base SAMPDBII.DBF and produce a sorted 
data base named SORTED.DBF.

     STORE "SAMPDBII.DBF"   TO INFILE
     STORE "SORTED.DBF"     TO OUTFILE
     STORE "SORT(2,24,C,A) F(DBII)" TO CTLSTMT
     DO SORTDBII                                       
     ? "RETCODE =",RETCODE                                
     ? "NUMREC  =",NUMREC
     ? "SAMPDBII.DBF SORTED TO SORTED.DBF"

Sample dBASE II Program Notes:

1. If you have updated your dBASE II file, you will 
need to use the 'USE' function to close the file so 
all data is written to the disk before Opt-Tech 
Sort is called.

2. If you sort a data base to itself you may need 
to perform the dBASE II 'USE' function to refresh 
the dBASE buffers.

3. If you do not want to use the command file 
SORTDBII.PRG, make sure that the functions 
contained within SORTDBII.PRG are performed by your 
command file.

4. The routine that is poked by SORTDBII.PRG will 
be destroyed (and need to be poked again) if you 
use the dBASE II sort command.


Using Opt-Tech Sort with dBASE II

Introduction

Sorting a dBASE II file from DOS is the same as 
using Opt-Tech Sort from DOS to sort any other 
file.   Chapter Three describes using Opt-Tech Sort   
from DOS.  
 
    
Sample dBASE II file Sort from DOS

The following example shows how to sort the 
SAMPDBII.DBF by Company name.

A>SORT
OPT-TECH SORT Version n.n
Copyright Opt-Tech Data Processing 1983-1988

Input filename(s):SAMPDBII.DBF
Output filename:SORTED.DBF
Control filename [Keyboard:]: (press "Enter") 
Enter Control Statement:
SORT(2,24,C,A) FILETYPE(DBII)

Notes:

1. The above sort control statement specifies a 
sort field starting position of 2 because position 
1 is occupied by a 'delete' byte.   

2. You must specify Filetype(DBII) on your control 
statement.
