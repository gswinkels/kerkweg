Sample Microsoft Fortran Program Notes:

1) The Opt-Tech Sort entry point used with 
Microsoft Fortran is "SORTF".

2) The INFILE, OUTFILE, and CTLSTMT parameters must 
be followed by a "/" (slash).  

3) RETCODE must be defined as a 2 byte integer.  
NUMRECS can be a 4 byte integer if you include the 
4Byte parameter on your control statement.

Linking Microsoft Fortran with Opt-Tech Sort

An example of linking the sample Microsoft Fortran 
program to Opt-Tech Sort is shown below. 

     A>LINK
     Object Modules[.OBJ]:XMSFOR + [SWnnK]
     Run File [XMSFOR.EXE]:   (enter is pressed)
     List File [NUL.MAP]:   (enter is pressed)
     Libraries [.LIB]:SORT

A sortwork area (SWnnK) may not be required when 
linking.  Please see 'Linking Opt-Tech Sort' and 
'Memory Considerations' in Chapter Four.
