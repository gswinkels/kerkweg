Sample Realia Cobol Program Notes:

1. The Opt-Tech Sort entry point used with Realia 
Cobol is SORTREAL.

2. The INFILE, OUTFILE, and CTLSTMT parameters must 
be followed by a "/" (slash).  

3. The NUM-RECS and RET-CODE parameters must be 
defined as COMP-5.


Linking Realia Cobol with Opt-Tech Sort

When linking, the Realia library file (REALCOB.LIB) 
must be specified last.
     
A>LINK
  Object Module [.OBJ]: XREALCOB
  Run File [XREALCOB.EXE]:      (press enter)
  List File [NUL.MAP]:          (press enter)

Realia Cobol File Types Supported

Opt-Tech supports the following type of Realia 
Cobol files.

1. t & n types are supported as standard text 
files.

2. b (byte stream) - can be handled as fixed length 
records, use the Record parameter or 
FILETYPE(FIX,nnn) on your control statement.

3. f (fixed length format, no delete byte) - can be 
handled if record length is between 4 and 512      
bytes.  Your control statement must specify the 
FILETYPE(FIX,nnn) parameter (or the Record 
parameter) and the Bypass-Header parameter.

4. d (fixed format with delete byte) - Handle as 
fixed length format 'f' above and add one to your 
control field positions to allow for the delete 
byte in the first position of each record.

5. v (variable) - specify filetype RV for Realia 
Variable.  You do not need to adjust your control 
field positions for the 1 or 2 byte record length 
header contained on these files.
