Sample Power BASIC Record Passing Program Notes.

Power Basic interfaces through SORTPBI.OBJ with 
the memory resident version of Opt-Tech Sort 
(SORTRES).  You must load SORTRES with a work 
area (/W parameter) before running a Power Basic 
program that calls Opt-Tech Sort.  See Chapter 
Four for information on loading SORTRES.

The interface file RSPBI.OBJ must be available 
when you compile your Power Basic program.
