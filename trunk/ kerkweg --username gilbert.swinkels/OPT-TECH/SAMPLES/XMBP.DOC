mbp Cobol Program Notes:

Linking Opt-Tech Sort with mbp Cobol

The SORT.LIB is required when linking your mbp
Cobol programs (otherwise you will get an
unresolved external reference SORTMBP).  If you 
use the LINK85.BAT or LINK85X.BAT you will have 
to add SORT.LIB to the LINK command where the 
other libraries are specified.

mbp indexed files are supported by the 
FILETYPE(MI2) parameter.  Sequential files are 
supported by FILETYPE(MS) for standard sequential
files and FILETYPE(TXT) for line sequential files.
