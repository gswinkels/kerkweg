Introduction to Sample Mark Williams C Programs

There is one Opt-Tech Sort sample program for use 
with Mark Williams C (XMWC.C).  This sample is 
set up for the MWC86 version but may be changed 
slightly to call different interface modules to run 
sample programs for the small and large MSDOS models.
Each model has a different interface name, compiler, 
compile command syntax, and unique linking 
requirements.

Sample MWC86 Program Notes:

1. You must call the interface appropriate 
interface module for the model you are using. 

2. The MWC86:csd interface name is SORTMWC which 
invokes the resident version of the sort. 
SORTRES must be loaded before invoking it. 

3. The small MS-DOS model Opt-Tech Sort interface 
is SORTMWS. The MS-DOS large model interface is 
SORTMWL.  

4. Each program model must be compiled using 
the appropriate version of the cc command. 


MWC86 Linking Requirements

There is a special object module (sortmwc.o) on the 
Opt-Tech Sort distribution diskette for linking 
with MWC86:csd programs.  Object modules for both 
the small (SORTMWS.OBJ) and large (SORTMWL.OBJ) MS-
DOS models are in SORT.LIB.  Mark Williams C does 
not allow Opt-Tech Sort to allocate memory 
dynamically.  You should link in a workarea size 
with the MS-DOS models and specify a workarea when 
loading SORTRES for the MWC:csd version.   

Sample MWC86:csd CC command:
cc xmwc.c sortmwc.o           

Sample small MS-DOS cc command
cc -vsmall xmws.c sortmws.obj swnnk.obj sort.lib  
                                        
Sample large MS-DOS cc command:
cc -vlarge xmwl.c sortmwl.obj swnnk.obj sort.lib          

A sortwork area (SWnnK) may not be required when 
linking.  Please see 'Linking Opt-Tech Sort' and 
'Memory Considerations' in chapter 4.
