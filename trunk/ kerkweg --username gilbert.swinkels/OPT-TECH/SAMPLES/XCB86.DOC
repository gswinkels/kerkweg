Sample CB-86 Program Notes

1) You must define a function for SORTCB86.

2) You must use VARPTR when passing the NUMRECS% 
and RETCODE% to Opt-Tech Sort.


Linking CB86 with Opt-Tech Sort

1) SORTRES must be loaded before you can call Opt-
Tech Sort from CB-86.  CB-86 does not allow Opt-
Tech Sort to dynamically allocate memory, therefore 
you should specify a memory workarea size when 
loading SORTRES.  See Chapter Four on loading 
SORTRES. 

2) When you link your CB-86 programs you must 
include the SORTCB86.OBJ module provided on your    
Opt-Tech Sort diskette. Example: 
C:>LINK86 XCB86,SORTCB86
