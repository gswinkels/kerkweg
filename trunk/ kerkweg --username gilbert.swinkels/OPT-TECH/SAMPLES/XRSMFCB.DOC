Sample Microfocus Cobol/2 Record Sort Program Notes

1. Opt-Tech Sort can be called from your cobol programs to perform a
"Record Sort" as shown in the sample program XRSMFCB.CBL.  You can
compile to a .OBJ or .GNT type of file with no changes in the source
code.  See information below for specific details when working with
.OBJ and .GNT type files.

2. The Record Sort interface module for Microfocus Cobol/2 is __RMFCB. 

3. The FUNC, LEN, and RET-CODE parameters must be defined as 2 byte
binary numbers COMP-5 and a PIC 9(4).

4. If you compile your program to a .OBJ file, then link your program
as shown below.  Note that XRSMFCB is the name of the sample program
and would be replaced by your program name.

     C:>LINK
     Object Modules[.OBJ]:XRSMFCB + [SWnnK /NOE]
     Run File [XRSMFCB.EXE]: (press enter)
     List File [NUL.MAP]:   (press enter)
     Libraries [.LIB]:SORT  

The SWnnk is one of Opt-Tech Sort's fixed size internal memory
sortwork areas e.g. SW20K.OBJ, SW40K.OBJ etc.  This fixed size area
is not required when you link with the Microfocus LCOBOL library.  If
you link with the COBLIB library you will need a fixed size workarea
unless you use the SET COBPOOL=nnn where nnn is the number of K bytes
of memory you want for the cobol runtime environment to leave free
for Opt-Tech Sort.

For example at the DOS command prompt enter: C:>SET COBPOOL=100   
(reserves 100K of memory)


5. If you compile your program to a .GNT file then you must make a
version of Opt-Tech Sort (__RMFCB.EXE) that your .GNT module can
call.

When compiling to a .GNT file you must make a __RMFCB.EXE module by
by compiling and linking as shown below.  You only need to produce
the __RMFCB.EXE one time.

First compile the Opt-Tech Sort to Microfocus Cobol interface module
__RMFCB.CBL to a .OBJ module as shown below.


     C:>cobol __rmfcb.cbl omf(obj)
     Object file-name [__RMFCB.OBJ]: (press enter)
     Source listing   [NUL]:			 (press enter)
     Object listing   [NUL]:			 (press enter)

Then link this object module with SORT.LIB as shown:

     C:>LINK
     Object Modules[.OBJ]:__RMFCB + [SWnnK /NOE]
     Run File [__RMFCB.EXE]: (press enter)
     List File [NUL.MAP]:    (press enter)
     Libraries [.LIB]:COBLIB SORT

This produces a file called __RMFCB.EXE that your .GNT program can
call when you use the RUN command.


The SWnnk is one of Opt-Tech Sort's fixed size internal memory
sortwork areas e.g. SW20K.OBJ, SW40K.OBJ etc.  This sortwork area is
not required if you use the SET COBPOOL=nnn DOS environment variable
where nnn is the number of K bytes of memory you want for the cobol
runtime environment to leave free for Opt-Tech Sort.

For example at the DOS command prompt enter:  C:>SET COBPOOL=100   
(reserves 100K of memory)
