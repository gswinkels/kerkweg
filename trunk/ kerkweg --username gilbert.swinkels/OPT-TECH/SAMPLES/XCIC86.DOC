Sample Computer Innovations C86 Program Notes:

1) The Opt-Tech Sort entry point used with CI 
C86 depends upon the memory model you are using. The 
entry point name is SORTC86S for the smallmodel and 
SORTC86B for the big model.


Linking Opt-Tech Sort with CI C86

You should be familiar with the normal procedure 
for linking C86 programs that is described in your 
C86 manual.  

     A>LINK
     Object Modules[.OBJ]:XCIC86
     Run File [XCIC86.EXE]:   (enter is pressed)
     List File [NUL.MAP]:   (enter is pressed)
     Libraries [.LIB]:C86SAS SORT

The above example shows linking a C86 program that 
was compiled under the small memory module.  Opt-
Tech Sort can be linked with the small and big 
memory models supported by C86, you should of 
course use the appropriate C86 library.
