Sample Microfocus Cobol/2 File Sort Program Notes

1. Opt-Tech Sort can be called from your cobol programs to perform a
"File Sort" as shown in the sample program XSMFCB.CBL.  You can
compile to a .OBJ or .GNT type of file with no changes in the source
code.  See information below for specific details when working with
.OBJ and .GNT type files.

2. The interface module for Microfocus Cobol/2 is __SMFCB. 

3. The INFILE, OUTFILE, and CTL-STMT parameters must be followed by a
"/" (slash).  

4. The RET-CODE parameter must be defined as 2 byte binary numbers
COMP-5 and a PIC 9(4).  NUM-RECS can be defined just like RET-CODE or
or PIC 9(9) COMP-5 if the 4BYTE parameter is used on your Opt-Tech
Sort Control Statement.

5. If you compile your program to a .OBJ file then link your program
as shown below.  Note that XSMFCB is the name of the sample program
and would be replaced by your program name.

     C:>LINK
     Object Modules[.OBJ]:XSMFCB + [SWnnK /NOE]
     Run File [XSMFCB.EXE]: (press enter)
     List File [NUL.MAP]:   (press enter)
     Libraries [.LIB]:SORT  

The SWnnk is one of Opt-Tech Sort's fixed size internal memory
sortwork areas e.g. SW20K.OBJ, SW40K.OBJ etc.  This fixed size area
is not required when you link with the Microfocus LCOBOL library.  If
you link with the COBLIB library you will need a fixed size workarea
unless you use the SET COBPOOL=nnn where nnn is the number of K bytes
of memory you want for the cobol runtime environment to leave free
for Opt-Tech Sort.

For example at the DOS command prompt enter: C:>SET COBPOOL=100   
(reserves 100K of memory)


6. If you compile your program to a .GNT file then you must make a
version of Opt-Tech Sort (__SMFCB.EXE) that your .GNT module can
call.

When compiling to a .GNT file you must make a __SMFCB.EXE module by
by compiling and linking as shown below.  You only need to produce
the __SMFCB.EXE one time.

First compile the Opt-Tech Sort to Microfocus Cobol interface module
__SMFCB.CBL to a .OBJ module as shown below.


     C:>cobol __smfcb.cbl omf(obj)
     Object file-name [__SMFCB.OBJ]: (press enter)
     Source listing   [NUL]:			 (press enter)
     Object listing   [NUL]:			 (press enter)

Then link this object module with SORT.LIB as shown:

     C:>LINK
     Object Modules[.OBJ]:__SMFCB + [SWnnK /NOE]
     Run File [__SMFCB.EXE]: (press enter)
     List File [NUL.MAP]:    (press enter)
     Libraries [.LIB]:COBLIB SORT

This produces a file called __SMFCB.EXE that your .GNT program can
call when you use the RUN command.


The SWnnk is one of Opt-Tech Sort's fixed size internal memory
sortwork areas e.g. SW20K.OBJ, SW40K.OBJ etc.  This sortwork area is
not required if you use the SET COBPOOL=nnn DOS environment variable
where nnn is the number of K bytes of memory you want for the cobol
runtime environment to leave free for Opt-Tech Sort.

For example at the DOS command prompt enter:  C:>SET COBPOOL=100   
(reserves 100K of memory)
