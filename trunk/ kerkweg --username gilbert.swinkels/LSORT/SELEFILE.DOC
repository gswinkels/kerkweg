SELEFILE is a small DOS program that allows you to select a file from a
list of files displayed on the screen.  It can be run stand-alone, although
there is no good reason to do so or from within another program.  SELEFILE
pops up over the existing screen and restores the screen on exit.

The syntax for SELEFILE is:

SELEFILE pathname [urc ulc rows cols normal reverse highlight [title]]

where:
     pathname    is the set of files to display.  * and ? are allowed.
                 (E.G. \dos\*.com -- will display all .COM files in the \DOS
                  directory)
     urc ulc     is the top left hand corner of the file display box.
                 These are specified relative to 0.  The default is 12,12
     rows        is the size of the window in rows, default is 12.
     cols        is the number of columns of file names to display, the default
                 is 4.
     normal      is a decimal number from 0 to 255 for the colors of a normal
                 (non high lighted display), the default is: 3 (CYAN on Black)
     reverse     is a decimal number from 0 to 255 for the colors of a reverse
                 video display.  The default is: 48 (Black on CYAN).
     highlight   is a decimal number from 0 to 255 for the colors of a high
                 lighted display.  The default is 17, but it is not used,
                 although it must be present if a title is specified.
     title       is the title that is to be displayed on the file selection
                 window.  It may also be placed in the environment using
                 SET TITLE=....

When the SELEFILE window is displayed, you can perform the following functions:

You can use the file selector to select a file from the list displayed
or change the list of files to be displayed or enter your own file name.

Position to a file using the arrow keys, PgUp, PgDn, HOME, END or by
typing the first letter of a file name.  HOME will display the list
starting at the first file.  END will display the list ending with the
last file.  Pressing the first letter of a file name will position the
cursor to the first file in the list which starts with that letter.
Press the RETURN key to select the high lighted file.

Other KEYS:

ESC will cancel without selecting a file

TAB allows you to enter a file name or change the files being displayed.
    When you press TAB, you can enter a file name or path name.  If a
    file name is entered, the File Selector will return that file name.
    If a directory is entered or wild card characters (*,?) are entered
    the File Selector will display the selected path.

F2  allows you to move the File Selector to a different position.


Example:

Use the SET TITLE option to set a title and display all the files in
D:\LSORT


Issue the following commands:

C:>set title=Files in Directory LSORT
C:>SELEFILE D:\LSORT\*.*

The following display will pop up:

 쿛osition to a file or directory(*), RETURN to Select, ESC to

A reverse video cursor will also display. The PgDn in the lower right hand
corner of the window indicates that there are more files, and that you can
see them by pressing PgDn.  If PgDn were pressed the display would change

PgDn is still displayed indicating that there are yet more files to see.  PgUp
