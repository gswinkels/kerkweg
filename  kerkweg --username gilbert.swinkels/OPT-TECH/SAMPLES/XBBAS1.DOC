
Sample Better Basic Version 1.1 program notes

1. The Opt-Tech Sort interface to Better Basic is 
   XSORTBB.BIN.  It must be declared as CODE at the 
   top of the program. You must also declare each 
   of the five variables used with Opt-Tech Sort at 
   the top of the program.

2. All assembler subroutines must be contained in 
   the same BIN file.  If your Better Basic program 
   requires additional assembler routines, integrate 
   your assembler routines' source into XSORTBB.ASM.  

Linking Better Basic program with Opt-Tech Sort

1. Better Basic programs do not get linked. 

2. XSORTBB.BIN must be on the disk when loading your 
   program.

3. Load SORTRES prior to running Better Basic. 
   SORTRES must be loaded with a specified workarea 
   size as Better Basic does not allow Opt-Tech 
   Sort to dynamically allocate memory.
