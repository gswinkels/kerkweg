Linking Opt-Tech Sort with MegaBasic

1) MegaBasic 'Links' to Opt-Tech Sort (SORTRES) 
through the interface file SORTMEGA.PGM.  
SORTMEGA.PGM must be available on the disk when 
you run your MegaBasic Program. 

2) SORTRES must be loaded prior to running your 
MegaBASIC program.
 
3) MegaBasic does not allow Opt-Tech Sort to 
dynamically allocate workarea.  A workarea size 
must be specified when loading SORTRES before 
executing your MegaBasic program.  See loading    
SORTRES in chapter 4.
