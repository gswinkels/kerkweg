Sample Microfocus Cobol Program Notes

1. The interface module for Microfocus Cobol is 
SORTMF.BIN 

2. The NUM-RECS and RET-CODE parameters must be 
defined as 2 byte binary numbers, a type of COMP 
and a PIC of 3 or 4 characters.

Linking Microfocus Cobol with Opt-Tech Sort

The Opt-Tech Sort interface SORTMF.BIN does not 
require linking with your program.  The file 
SORTMF.BIN must be in the same directory as the 
program calling it.  It is loaded when called.   


Microfocus Cobol Filetypes

Sequential files - This type of file contains fixed 
length records, the record length is that of the 
longest record defined in the File Descriptor (FD). 
To sort this type of file, specify your sort 
control fields and filetype FIXed specifying the 
record length.

Line Sequential files - This type of file can be 
sorted if the records are terminated by carriage 
return, line feed. Files of this type with the TAB 
character expanded to the next (8*N)+1 position can 
be sorted by specifying FILETYPE(TAB). As the 
records are variable length, do not specify a 
Record length or FIXed filetype.

Relative files - This type of file has two 
additional bytes appended onto the end of each 
record.  You can sort a relative file by specifying 
your Sort control fields and FIXed filetype with 
the record length + 2 bytes specified.

Indexed files - The data portion of an indexed file 
is the same structure as a relative file above. 
Thus you can sort the data portion of an indexed 
file (like a relative file) and then access it as a 
relative file or sequential file.
