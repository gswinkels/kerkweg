True BASIC Program Notes

1) You must include a Library statement for the 
True Basic interface "SORTTB.TRC" and the interface 
must be available on disk.
   
2) The variables NUMREC and RETCODE must be              
integers.


Linking Opt-Tech Sort with True Basic

1) Opt-Tech Sort does not require linking with True 
BASIC.  However, SORTRES must be loaded prior to 
running your True BASIC program.
 
2) True BASIC does not allow Opt-Tech Sort to 
dynamically allocate workarea.  A workarea size 
must be specified when loading SORTRES before 
executing your True BASIC program.  See loading    
SORTRES in chapter 4.
