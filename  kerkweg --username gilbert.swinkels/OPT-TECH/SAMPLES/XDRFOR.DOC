Sample Digital Research Fortran 77 program notes.

1. The modules SORTF77S.OBJ and SORTF77L.OBJ are 
the small and large model interfaces between Opt-
Tech Sort and DR F77.  These modules provide an 
interface to the resident version of Opt-Tech Sort 
(SORTRES).  SORTRES must be loaded with a workarea 
(/W parameter).  See Chapter Four, for more 
information on loading SORTRES.

2.  Your Fortran program must call SORTF77S or
SORTF77L depending upon the memory model you are 
using.

3.  An example of Linking the sort interface module 
is provided:  LINK86 YOURPGM, SORTF77L
