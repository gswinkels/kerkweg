Sample Quick BASIC 4.0 notes.

Opt-Tech Sort can be used with Quick BASIC either 
from within the Quick BASIC environment or when 
using BC, the command line version of the compiler.  
The method of LINKing with Opt-Tech Sort is 
different depending upon the version you are using.

When using BC, the output from compiling is a .OBJ 
file.  This .OBJ file can be then LINKed with Opt-
Tech Sort as shoiwn below.

C:>LINK
Object Modules [.OBJ]: XQB4
Run File [XQB4.EXE]:     (press enter)
List File [NUL.MAP]:     (press enter)
Libraries [.LIB]: SORT   

If you want to use Opt-Tech Sort from within the 
Quick BASIC environment, you will need to include 
some of Opt-Tech Sort's modules into a Quick 
Library (.QLB) and a stand-alone library (.LIB).  
These libraries can be created as shown below.

C:>LINK /Q SORTIBMB SW0K SORT
Run File [SORTIBMB.QLB]: QB
List File [NUL.MAP]:     (press enter)
Libraries [.LIB]: BQLB40

The above example builds a Quick Library named 
QB.QLB which contains SORTIBMB.OBJ, SW0K.OBJ and 
SORT.OBJ.  These object modules are contained on 
the Opt-Tech Sort master diskette.  You also need 
to build a parallel stand-alone library as shown 
below.

C:>LIB
Library name: QB
Operations: +SORTIBMB +SW0K +SORT
List file:    (press enter)
Output library: QB

After building the .QLB and the .LIB Opt-Tech Sort 
can be used within the Quick BASIC 4.0 environment 
by using the Quick BASIC /L option.

The NUMREC variable returned from Opt-Tech Sort can 
be a "LONG INTEGER" if you specify the 4Byte 
parameter on your control statement.

You may want to review the SETMEM function in your 
Quick BASIC manual.  The 100,000 bytes freed in the
above sample is just used as an example.  More or 
less memory can be freed for use by Opt-Tech Sort.
