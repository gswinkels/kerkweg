Sample Interpreted BASIC Record Passing Program Notes.

1) Lines 155-160 obtain and define the segment 
address where SORTIBAS is loaded.

2) RSIBAS must be set to 6 as is shown in line 162.


Linking Interpreted BASIC with Opt-Tech Sort:

Interpreted BASIC (BASIC, BASICA, GWBASIC) calls 
Opt-Tech Sort through SORTIBAS which invokes 
SORTRES.  Both these programs are load into your 
computers memory and remain there until you reboot
your computer.  These programs must be loaded by 
running them at the DOS command prompt before you
can call Opt-Tech Sort from within your programs.


How to load SORTIBAS

SORTIBAS is a resident program that provides the 
interface between the BASIC interpreter and the 
resident version of Opt-Tech Sort (SORTRES).
SORTIBAS is loaded simply by running the program 
SORTIBAS from DOS.  The format of the command is:

     SORTIBAS [filename]

The filename parameter is optional, it specifies 
the name of the file that the segment address 
(DEF SEG) of SORTIBAS  will be written to.  If a 
filename is not specified the DEF SEG address will 
be written to a file named SORTIBAS.SEG.  This file 
contains the address where SORTIBAS is loaded.  

Once SORTIBAS is loaded, it remains in memory until 
you turn off or reboot your computer.

Since SORTIBAS and SORTRES work together, both 
programs must be loaded before you can call 
SORTIBAS from interpreted BASIC.  You can load 
these programs in either order but if you want to 
remove SORTRES from memory with the /R parameter, 
SORTRES must be the last program loaded.

IBM Interpreted BASIC allows Opt-Tech Sort to 
dynamically allocate memory, so SORTRES can be 
loaded without specifying a workarea size.  

GWBASIC does not allow Opt-Tech Sort to dynamically 
allocate memory so specify a workarea size when 
loading SORTRES.
