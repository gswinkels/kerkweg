Sample Turbo Basic program notes.

Turbo Basic interfaces through SORTBTB.COM with the 
memory resident version of Opt-Tech Sort (SORTRES).  
You must load SORTRES with a work area (/W 
parameter) before running a Turbo Basic 
program that calls Opt-Tech Sort.  See Chapter Four 
for information on loading SORTRES.

The interface file SORTBTB.COM must be available 
when you compile your Turbo Basic program.
