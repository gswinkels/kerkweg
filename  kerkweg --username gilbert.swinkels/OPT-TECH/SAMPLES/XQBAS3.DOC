Notes for Quick Basic Version 2 & 3

When using Quick Basic Version 2 or 3 and you are 
producing an .OBJ module then you should use the 
information below to link your program.  
 
A>LINK  
Object Modules[.OBJ]:XQBAS3 [+ SWnnK]
Run File [XQBAS3.EXE]:      (press enter)
List File [NUL.MAP]:        (press enter)
Libraries [.LIB]:SORT.LIB

A sortwork area (SWnnK) may not be required when 
linking.  You can use the /CP linker parameter as
described in 'Linking Opt-Tech Sort' and 'Memory 
Considerations' in chapter 4 to eliminate linking
of a fixed size sortwork area (SWnnK).  Note, if 
your program is chained or run from another BASIC 
program, then the /CP parameter must be used when 
you link the first program in the series.  That 
is, you must use the /CP linker parameter on the 
program that is run from the DOS prompt.

If you want to compile directly to a memory or to 
an .EXE file then you must use the BUILDLIB 
facility included with Quick Basic.  Examples are 
shown below for both the SORTIBMB and SORTIBMR 
interfaces.

If you are calling SORTIBMB use:
  C:>buildlib 
  Object Modules [.OBJ]: SORTIBMB + sw30k
  Run File [USERLIB.EXE]:      (press enter)
  List File [NUL.MAP]:         (press enter)
  Libraries [.LIB]: SORT

If you are calling SORTIBMR use:
  C:>buildlib 
  Object Modules [.OBJ]: SORTIBMR
  Run File [USERLIB.EXE]:      (press enter)
  List File [NUL.MAP]:         (press enter)
  Libraries [.LIB]:            (press enter)

Now use the /L option when you invoke Quick Basic 
and Opt-Tech Sort will be available to you.
