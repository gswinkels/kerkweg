Sample Turbo C program notes.

1. SORT.LIB contains the interface files needed for 
interfacing Turbo C with Opt-Tech Sort.  SORT.LIB 
can be specified in a Turbo C Project File so that 
Turbo C can find the routines necessary when 
linking your programs that call Opt-Tech Sort.

2. The Opt-Tech Sort entry point name depends upon 
the memory model that you are using.  The format of 
the entry point name is SORTTCx where x is either 
S, M, C, or L representing the Small, Medium, 
Compact or Large model. Huge programs can also use 
the L entry point.  The entry point name must be in 
upper-case letters.
