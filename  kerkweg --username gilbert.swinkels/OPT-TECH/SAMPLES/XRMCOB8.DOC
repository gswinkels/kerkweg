Linking RM Cobol 8.x with Opt-Tech Sort

RM Cobol does not require linking with Opt-Tech 
Sort.  However, SORTRM8X.EXE must be on the default 
drive and directory when running your program.  
SORTRES must be loaded before running your RM Cobol 
program.  SORTRES can use dynamic memory 
allocation.
