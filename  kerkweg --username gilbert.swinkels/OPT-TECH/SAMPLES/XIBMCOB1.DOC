Sample IBM Cobol Ver 1.x Program Notes:
  
1. The Opt-Tech Sort entry point used with IBM 
Cobol is "SORTIC".  

2. The input filename, output filename and control 
statement parameters must be followed by a "/" 
(slash).  

3. The NUM-RECS and RET-CODE should be defined as 
COMP-0 (binary).

Linking IBM Cobol with Opt-Tech Sort

Below is a sample link of Opt-Tech Sort and the 
sample program with your input underlined.

A>LINK XIBMCOB1 [+ SWnnK]
Run File [XIBMCOB1.EXE]:      (press enter)
List File [NUL.MAP]:          (press enter)
Libraries [.LIB]:SORT

A sortwork area (SWnnK) may not be required when 
linking.  Please see 'Linking Opt-Tech Sort' and 
'Memory Considerations' in Chapter Four.


IBM Cobol Filetypes

IBM Cobol supports a number of unique filetypes 
as explained below.  

Cobol Indexed files require a Filetype(CI) 
parameter to be coded on the sort control 
statement. A complete discussion is given in the 
description of the CI filetype in Chapter Five.

Cobol Sequential files require a Filetype(CS)  
parameter to be coded on the sort control 
statement. A complete discussion is given in the 
description of the CS filetype in Chapter Five.

Cobol Relative files require a Filetype(CR) 
parameter to be coded on the sort control 
statement. A complete discussion is given in the 
description of the CS filetype in Chapter Five.
  
A Cobol Relative output file instead of the default 
output filetype (same type as the input file) can 
be obtained by using the OUTFile(CR) parameter.  
This facility allows you to request ADDRess OUTput 
files or KEY OUTput files to be written out as 
random files for use with binary searches, etc.  A    
complete description is given in the Outfile 
parameter description in Chapter Five.
