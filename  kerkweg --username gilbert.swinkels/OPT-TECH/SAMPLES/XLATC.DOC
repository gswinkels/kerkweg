Sample Lattice C Program Notes:

1) Please note, for Lattice C version 3.3 or later 
the Microsoft C entry points should be used.  Memory 
models correspond as follows.

Lattice C model        Microsoft entry point
  S                      SORTMSCS
  D                      SORTMSCC
  P                      SORTMSCM
  L                      SORTMSCL
  H                      SORTMSCL
The file SORT1ST.OBJ is not required for Lattice C 
version 3.3 or later.

2) The Opt-Tech Sort entry point used with Lattice 
C depends upon the Lattice C memory model you are 
using.  The entry point name is SORTLATx where x is 
either S,D,P,L depending upon the memory model.  In 
the above example the small memory module was used 
so the entry point was SORTLATS. 


Linking Opt-Tech Sort with Lattice C

You should be familiar with the normal procedure 
for linking Lattice C programs that is described in 
your Lattice C manual.

Note: You must specify SORT1ST as the first object 
module.  A sample link session is shown below.  

Example:

     A>LINK
     Object Modules[.OBJ]:SORT1ST + "x" + XLATC
     Run File [SORT1ST.EXE]:XLATC
     List File [NUL.MAP]:     (enter is pressed)
     Libraries [.LIB]:"y" SORT

In the above example "x" represents the object 
module normally linked first as specified in your 
Lattice C documentation.  "y" represents the 
appropriate Lattice C library file.  Opt-Tech Sort 
can be linked with all four memory models.  The 
Opt-Tech Sort "first" module (SORT1ST) and library 
(SORT) are the same for all Lattice memory models.
