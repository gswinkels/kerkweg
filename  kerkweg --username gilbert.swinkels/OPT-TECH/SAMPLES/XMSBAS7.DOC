Sample Microsoft BASIC 7 notes for DOS.

Opt-Tech Sort can be used with BASIC 7 either 
from within the QBX environment or when using BC, 
the command line version of the compiler.  The 
method of LINKing with Opt-Tech Sort is different 
depending upon the version you are using.

When using BC, the output from compiling is a .OBJ 
file.  This .OBJ file can be then LINKed with Opt-
Tech Sort as shown below.

C:>LINK
Object Modules [.OBJ]: XMSBAS7
Run File [XMSBAS7.EXE]:  (press enter)
List File [NUL.MAP]:     (press enter)
Libraries [.LIB]: SORT   

If you want to use Opt-Tech Sort from within the 
Quick BASIC environment, you will need to include 
some of Opt-Tech Sort's modules into a Quick 
Library (.QLB) and a stand-alone library (.LIB).  
These libraries can be created as shown below.

C:>LINK /Q SORTMSB7 SW0K SORT
Run File [SORTMSB7.QLB]: (press enter)
List File [NUL.MAP]:     (press enter)
Libraries [.LIB]: QBXQLB

The above example builds a Quick Library named 
SORTMSB7.QLB which contains SORTMSB7.OBJ, SW0K.OBJ
and SORT.OBJ.  These object modules are contained
on the Opt-Tech Sort master diskette.  You also 
need to build a parallel stand-alone library as 
shown below.

C:>LIB
Library name: SORTMSB7
Library does not exist.  Create? (y/n) y
Operations: +SORTMSB7 +SW0K +SORT
List file:    (press enter)

After building the .QLB and the .LIB Opt-Tech Sort 
can be used within the QBX environment by using 
the /L option specifying the SORTMSB7.QLB.


If you want to build an extended run-time module 
as described in your BASIC 7.0 manual, the 
following export list can be used.
      
      #OBJECTS
      SORT
      SW0K
      SORTMSB7
      #EXPORTS
      SORTMSB7


The NUMREC variable returned from Opt-Tech Sort can 
be a "LONG INTEGER" if you specify the 4Byte 
parameter on your control statement.

You may want to review the SETMEM function in your 
BASIC manual.  The 100,000 bytes freed in the above 
sample is just used as an example.  More or less 
memory can be freed for use by Opt-Tech Sort.
