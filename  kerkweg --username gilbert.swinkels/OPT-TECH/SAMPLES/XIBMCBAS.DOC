IBM Compiled BASIC Interface to SORTRES

An alternative interface is provided for Compiled 
Basic programs which allows calling the resident 
SORTRES.  This alternative interface is called 
SORTIBMR.  All source code is the same as the 
SORTIBMB interface shown above except the name of 
the interface module CALLed is SORTIBMR. 

Users of the SORTIBMR interface should read 
"Loading the Resident Sort - SORTRES" in Chapter 
Four SORTRES must be loaded before running any 
compiled BASIC program calling the SORTIBMR 
interface.
